```

### Available Types

  _Example: `fix: correct overflow issue in mobile view`_

- **ci** → Updates to GitHub workflows, Husky, or CI/CD configurations
- **test** → Updates to tests or testing configurations
- **revert** → Reverting previous commits

  _Example: `vercel: trigger deployment`_

### Additional Guidelines

  Specify a scope if needed (e.g., `feat(pre-event): add date label`). Omit if not applicable.
- **Description:**  
  Provide a concise yet detailed explanation of the changes.
- **Formatting:**
  - Use the imperative mood (e.g., `add`, not `added`).
  - Start with a lowercase letter.
  - Do not end with a full stop.
- **Multiple Changes:**  
  Commit changes separately if multiple unrelated changes are made.

## Testing and Quality Checks

### TypeScript Type Checking

Ensure your code is type-safe:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

### Linting

Check your code quality with ESLint:

```bash
pnpm lint:strict
```

### Prettier

Ensure consistent code formatting:

```bash
pnpm format:check
```

---

## Deployment

Each pull request will automatically trigger a preview deployment on Vercel. Once the pull request is closed or merged, the preview deployment is automatically removed. This enables you to test changes in a live environment before merging into the main branch.
